IT326 Data Mining Project — Phase 1 (Data Selection)

Project Goal:
Apply data mining techniques — classification and clustering — on the Mushroom dataset to distinguish edible vs. poisonous mushrooms and explore meaningful groupings.

Motivation:
We chose this dataset because it is large (8,000+ instances), has 20+ categorical features, and includes a clear class label (class: edible vs. poisonous). It is widely used for benchmarking classification tasks and is suitable for clustering exploration.
