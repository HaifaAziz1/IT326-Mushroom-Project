IT326 Data Mining Project â€” Phase 1 (Data Selection)

Concise Project Description (Introducing the Problem):
Consuming poisonous mushrooms is dangerous and can be life-threatening. 
The project addresses the problem of identifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous 
based on its features. This classification helps reduce risks to human health.

Objectives (What do we want to solve?):
- Classify mushrooms into edible vs. poisonous using their categorical features.
- Apply clustering methods to group mushrooms with similar characteristics.

Project Motivation (Why is it important?):
We chose this dataset because it is large (over 8,000 instances), 
has more than 20 categorical features, and includes a clear class label. 
It is widely used in machine learning education and research, 
making it suitable for practicing classification and clustering tasks.
